## making tasks in zed
There are two types of tasks in Zed. One is a one that only works in the folder, and the other is a one that is all applied to every workspace. The global one is placed on the location `~/.config/zed/tasks.json`, and the local one is placed in `.zed/tasks.json`.

Using `Ctrl + Shift + P` and selecting `zed: open tasks` will open the global config, and selecting `zed: open local tasks` will open the local config.
